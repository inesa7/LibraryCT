2 scenarios for amazon search function :

2. user search invalid item   -> negative 


Can you describe to me what makes up a good Test Case?

 - test case is a set of steps , it has ID, description, pre-con, steps, data, environment , expected result 

 - steps should match the function , 

 - all the elements of test case should be assigned
 - steps should be written small & short 
 - expected result should be clear at the end 

Where do you get test data? 
- 1. Dev/ test-data team  is written it in the story , its given 
         - app credentials 

- 2. I generate data from dummy data website 
       - upload file -> pdf & word files --> you can create several files to test 

       - fill out a form -> Fname, Lname, DOB, ZipCode, email --> google -dummy data 

       - Java Faker -> provide fake data 
               String  firstname = faker.name()
               long zip = faker.zipCode()
          
Tell me about your smoke test : 
- definition , purpose of testing it 

- 75 scenarios - 20 m - at 8am - email from Jenkins

   one mistakes you learned from last sprint:
   - jira -> priority is high , i assigned as low, 
-----------------------
please prepare 3:
              user stories 
              bugs 
              retro topic -> sth wrong, sth good , new idea 

5. tell me your a typical day:

9. tell me steps to handle a bug: check my own device 
                                  run my test case multiple times to confirm its a valid 
                                  assign to dev, dev to fix it 
                                  i will re-tests == test again 

10. re-testing vs regression testing? 
    - re-test -> testing agin one story after 

    - regression : every 2 months - 600 - 1.5 
                   every week 

                   Aug - Oct/20--> 3 months == 6 sprints == 200 new scen
                  
                   sprint Oct5-20 --> entire sprint is used to perform regression 
                                      600 + 200 = 800 scenarios 

                                      manually -> several days -> 200 + select 100-150 from 600 

                                      automation -> 2 hours  

11. parallel testing : running the test scenarios with multiple devices 
       800 -> 1 windows --> 6 hours 

       200  200  200  200 -> 1.5 hours 

12. DOD : checklist : if a story can be moved to the done on demo meeting 

        1. is that user story's all the test cases are executed? 
        2. is there any bug?

        4. automation is covered? 
        5. all possible scenarios are covered?

   DOR: checklist, if that story can be taken to the SB in SP meeting?

     2. is it a small story? 
     3. is it estimated? 
     4. is there at least 1 AC ? 
     5. is it prioritized ? 

Entry criteria / input -> pre-condition that you have to have in order to move the next step 

          what is entry criteria for writing a test case? 
           - must have data , scenarios , jira 

           how entry criteria is used in test plan:

              - requirement 
              - environments 
              - this test plan doc should be ready 

Exit criteria / output -> condition that has to be ready before close the step. 

           what is exit criteria for  a test case? 
           - each steps is written 
           - test data are provided 
           - expected result should be written
           - linked to your user story 
          
        how exit criteria is used in test plan: 
           what is our exit criteria to end test execution ? 
            - all the test cases should be tested 
            - evidence provided 
            - 80-85% automation , 15-20% manual
