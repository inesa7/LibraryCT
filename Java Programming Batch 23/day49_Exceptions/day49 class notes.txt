Exception: unexpected or unwanted events

		unchecked exception (unexpected event): occurs during the runtime

					RuntimeException class is the parent of all the unchecked exception

					All the runtime exceptions are unchecked exception


		checked exception (unwanted event): occurs during the compile time

					All the exceptions that are not runtime exceptions are checked exception

Exception Handlings:
		
		1. try & catch blocks: used for handling both checked and unchecked exceptions

				try{
					exception code	
				}catch(ExceptionClass e){
					statements
				}

				multi-catch block: parent exception type CAN NOT be placed before child exception type


				finally block: always gets executed regardless of the exception


	2. throws keyword: used for handling checked exceptions ONLY


				 caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception


	throw keyword: manually throw an exception
		
		throw ObjectOfException
