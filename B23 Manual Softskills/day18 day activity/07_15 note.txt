---------------------------

Agenda review -> STLC 
 
kahoot 

Day to day activity 


=============================


Req analyze : understand the business req / user story & AC 

              which layer of the app ? UI/FrontEnd ? DB? API

              manually vs automatically? 


Test plan : a document , that created by a team lead or a tester

             how often do you write a test plan? 
                - we have a test plan per release -> common way 

            always have a "test plan meeting"  
            
            testing schedule,

            testing strategy ->scope of testing(different types of testing) & testing tools, testing framework - BDD cucumber 

            resources : software & hardware

            role & responsibility 

            risk & mitigation  

            approval -> always multiple people approve the doc 
                       PO, PM, team lead (when its done by a tester)


Test case creation : a document -> ID, scenario, data, pre-condition, test env, and test steps , expected result 

                 who write a test case? 
                 - testers 
                 - BA (possible)

                 2 types of test case :
                  1. Positive test case -> using valid data 
                  2. Negative test case -> using invalid data , without data 


                2 types of test steps :
                   1. manual test step
                   2. cucumber test step

                ID -> Jira auto generate for you 

                Test data -> where do you get your test data? 
                            
                            1. I use dummy data website to generate 

                            2. sometimes I got data from my developer/BA for the valid data

                            3. some company has "data provider" team  - not common
                            

                  pre-condition: not all the test case need a pre-cond.
                                 Delete sth, edit , download, 

                How do you evaluate if a test case is a good or bad? 
                    - a test case should have all the necessary elements -id, scenario, test data, pre-condition, test env, and test steps , expected result. 

                    - test steps should written in detail 

                 do we use a test case for manual testing or automation as well? 
                    - both 


interview question: 
open FB login page, and write several test cases:


list test scenarios == all possible area to test == what to test? 
                    
1. login with valid credential (username & password) -> positive scenario 
2. login with valid user name , invalid password  -> negative 
3. login with invalid username -> negative 
4. login without any data  -> negative 
5. re-set password when user forget it - provide valid username -> posit
6. re-set password with invalid username -> negative 


to become test cases : we should provide all elements of test case doc

1. login with valid credential (username & password) -> positive scenario 

Test case: 
test case ID: fb01 
test scenario :  login with valid credential 
test data : valid username: 
                  password: 

test environment: https://www.facebook.com/

test steps : this is manual test step:   
           step1: user go to FB login page 
           step2: enter valid username 
           step3: enter valid password 
           step4: click "log in" button 
           step5: verify user login successfully and launched in the fb home page


test steps with Cucumber version --> we need to use Gherkin language 
                                         Given When And Then 

           Given user on the FB login page 
           When enter valid username 
           And enter valid password 
           When click "log in" button 
           Then verify user login successfully and launched in the fb home page
----------

Test environment -> dev env func should be deployed to QA env. 
                    Done by DevOps team with Jenkins app. 


Test execution ==> start manual & automation testing 

                     expected result vs actual result 

                     pass -> test will end 

                   fail -> in manual testing -> create a bug report, do not automate
                                                move to another user story

                    manual test passed - automation fail ->
                                                  create a bug report 
                                                  move to another user story

                   
                UI testing : 

                manual testing -> go to the app, follow your test case 
                                  expected result vs actual result 

                                  no matter pass or fail, need to provide evidence 
                                   - screenshot, screenvideo 


               automation testing -> you run your code -> java+selenium+junit 
                                    expected result vs actual result 

                                    - recommend take a screenshot of IDE result 


Bug life cycle : 

happy scenario for a bug handling: 

bug status: 
   New -> Assign -> Open -> Fix -> re_test -> close 


   New -> Assign -> Open -> Fix -> re_test -> assign back to dev 

   New -> Assign -> Open -> differed -> re_test -> close 


   New -> Assign -> Open -> reject 
                                  1. duplicated -> 2 qa wrote the same bug report
                                  2. invalid  -> 



--------------------------

test cycle closure -> in agile, if i am done with the user story ? 

                      - all the test cases are executed 
                      - any bug report is written , bug is removed 


                      is this sprint's user stories are all done? 

                      - demo meeting at the end of the sprint - PO 

                      - team lead & business team analyze some reports from the sprint 
                         sprint report -> how many stories are completed 
                                          how much % of manual vs automation 
                                          each member's time spent on testing 


What is STLC? can you tell me your steps of how you perform testing? 


---------------------------------


Test scenario review -> a meeting 
                        When BA writes AC in cucumber gherkin style, BA and the all the testers write AC - test cases / test scenario together 




Brown bag session  --> Testers teach developers how to test the project 

                      1 qa -> slides + example code
