 Scrum 3 roles: PO, SM, Dev team 

 Scrum 3 artifacts : Product backlog , Sprint backlog , Burndown chart 


 Scrum 5 meetings: 

1. Grooming-> PO explains user stories 
              Giving points 

2. Sprint planning -> Take / pull / select user stories from PB to SB 
                      based on team capacity & team velocity 

                      take only user stories that are match with "DOR" list

3. Daily stand up -> 3 Questions 
                     What I did yesterday/ last business day? 
                     What i am going to do today? 
                     is there any issue ? problem? blocker? 
                    
                    attendee : SM, dev team 
                    PO/BA -> optional , 

                    time-> 15 minutes 

Burn down chart -> auto generated by Jira app 
                   SM shows during the Stand up meeting to remind the dev team about how much work is left 




4. Demo meeting -> demo to what dev team has done during the sprint 
                 - PO accepts / rejects a user story based on "DOD" list 

                  
                   how the team decide if a user story is "DONE" ? 
                     - Definition of Done (DOD ) 
                        - user story unit testing passed 
                        - user stories all the test cases are executed 
                        - if any bug is found,  the bug status is defined 
                        - code reviewed -> developers code / QA code 

                         attendee: scrum team -> PO who accept / reject user stories

                           or  the client & scrum team 
                           or many teams 


5. Retro meeting -> retrospective -> go back / reviewing 
            
                    SM and the dev team 

                    3 questions : 
                    1. What went well ? 
                    2. What went wrong? 
                    3. What could be done differently to make a improve? 

1 way to conduct retro: 
  SM gives 3 colored papers to the dev team 
     - red - What went wrong? 
     green - What went well ? 
    yellow - What could be done differently 


another way to have retro: 
 - just answer the 3 questions by taking turns 



DOR -> definition of ready? 

deciding is a user story is "READY" to be selected in to Sprint backlog 


 - used in the sprint planning meeting

     
  - user story is already explained by PO 
  - User story is INVEST 
  - estimated /sized 


Both DOD, DOR decided by the dev team & PO together.
     When ? -> before starting to work on a new project . 
               So it is everyone's responsibility. 



before starting to work on a new project, before starting sprint 1, 
 the Scrum team & PO decide many things together:

1. Sprint cycle 
2. Team name 
3. sprint starting date 
4. DOR & DOD lists 
5. Testing tools / languages to use 
6. framework types 
7. Scrum meeting times / frequency 
8. select a team leader  -> or PM already hired someone as team lead 





10m break : 4:18 pm 



tell me about yourself : 

- OS types -> Windows, IOS 
- multiple browsers -> Chrome, safari, Edge ..
