Agenda: 

Smoke regression

blackbox testing vs white box testing 

parallel testing 

cross-browser testing


Smoke test scenario criteria decided by the all testers: 

 - if that feature is a major / critical feature of the app? 
 - which scenarios are important ? 


how it run: automatically , scheduled on Jenkins 
time to run smoke average: 15m - 30m
total scenario: 50 - 90 
frequency : once a day, before qa team starts the day 
            e.g: 5am, 6am, 7am 
result: email 




regression :

major reg: perform before each release // performed before deploying all the features of the app from QA env -> stg env. 

    how many scenarios : 500 - 3000
    how long does it take to run : 
    how often do you perform regression ?  every 3-6 months   
                                           it depends on our app's feature
    both automation & manual regression performed


minor reg: everyday? once a week? once a month? 
           automatically perform
