                                               PO wrote user stories & store them 

                         2. Sprint backlog -> 1 SB per sprint 
                         					SM creates / starts / ends a sprint backlog
                                              SM & dev team responsible manage the SB 

                         3. Burndown chart -> report , sprint report 

                                              total amount of points that burns each everyday 

                                              reminds the dev team remainder work amount / story points

                                              SM opens and shows this during the daily stand up 


      Scrum 5 events / meetings : 

                1. Grooming 

                        - PO explains each user stories 
                        - Dev team + PO -> estimate points 

                        - estimation based on - Fibonacci scale
                            1,2,3,5,8,13,21 

                        attendee : Scrum team


                2. Sprint planning -> take / pull stories from product to sprint backlog 

                        - SM creates Sprint backlog 

                        - Scrum team figure out : what exact user stories to work on during the sprint? how many points we  				can finish n this sprint? 

                        - answered depends on team capacity

                        - team capacity == points that team can finish a sprint 

                      e.g.: 3 dev 2 qa --> total team capacity = 40 

                     sprint1; dev1- 1 day off 
                              QA2 - 2 days off 

                              40 - 3 = 37 


                      sprint2: no day off 
                                team capacity = points - 40



     team capacity : total work availability of dev team in a sprint


     in Sprint planning: 

                    - some team leaders assign user stories /tasks to specific team members during the meeting 


                    - people just randomly take user stories to work on 


     Sprint backlog -> list of stories that should be done during a sprint / current sprint 

                Daily stand up 
                Demo 
                Retro 

    
      1  user story --> 3 points 

      1 point = 1 day 

      3 points = 3 days effort to Develop & test == 2 days to develop + 1 day to test 

     
      1 project 

             1 PO      ST        DevOps team     performance team   ST   UAT designer 



	On the sprint plain meeting,  the SM (she/he) has one day off. Who is handle SM responsible on the day?

  	- in my team ,BA / PO handle it 


		dev team -> 3 dev & 2 qa --> one of them is a team/tech lead 

            	8 dev -> tech leader 
            	5 qa  -> qa team leader / qa manager
