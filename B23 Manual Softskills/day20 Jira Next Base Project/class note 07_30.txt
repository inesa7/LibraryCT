                                what your team members have done 

Projects -> one company has many projects. 
            For each project, SM creates 1 project on Jira which includes all docs.

            eg: NextBaseCRM company has: HR app
                                         document app
                                         crm app --> your project

==================

users types for CRM app? 

- HR 
- Marketing 
- HelpDesk 


login function: 

HR login-> 6 modules 
marketing login -> dashboard 
helpdesk login-> 8 modules

user forget password? 
user forget username?
user login with empty inout box?

user wants to save credential in the computer


how many test case/s i will create? 

successful login -> 1 test case -> all 3 types of users login successfully 

user forget password?  user forget username? -> 1 test case -> "Incorrect login or password" 


empty ? -> 1 test case (it cannot be merged with the above test case because the steps are different)


check"remember me on this computer" -> 1 test case


test case for successful login :
test case #1 
test case summary/scenario -> login successfully 

test case steps: user go to login page 
                 verify the tile is "Authorization"
                 verify the header is "Authorization"
                 enter credentials / enter username & password 
                 click login button 
                 verify user is on the homepage 

test data: HR credentials: hr1@cyebrteschool.com 
           helpdesk : helpdes@cyebrteschool.com 
           marketing: marketing@cyebrteschool.com 

although this is just 1 test case, but when I manually test, I test for all 3 roles several times. 


estimation -> effort , do you have experience on the same function? 
              risk ? small?
