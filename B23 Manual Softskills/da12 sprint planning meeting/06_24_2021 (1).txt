Review : 

1. Agile is the most famous software / project management methodology 

     Agile has many frameworks / branches : Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean, etc...

     Virginia state == Fairfax, Chantilly, Alexandria 

     Agile != Scrum 


2. Scrum is of the types/branches /frameworks of Agile

     Scrum-ban == Scrum + kanban 

   Scrum 3 roles : PO, SM, Dev team (dev & qa)
  
   Scrum 5 events / meetings : Grooming meeting 
                               Sprint planning meeting 


   Scrum 3 artifacts :  1. Product backlog
   							there is one only PB for one project 
                             PO owns the PB 
                             PO stores the Users tories , other tasks
                             PO prioritize the stories 
                             any changes for req is welcome 


                        2. Sprint backlog
                        	there are many SB 
                        	for each sprint, we have 1 SB
                        	changes are not welcome 
                        	SM and dev team use / manage the SB



    
Key words : Sprint - time box  1 week - 4 weeks, 2 weeks is the most chosen sprint


Grooming meeting --> 
            Before the Grooming: PO write/prepare user stories & its AC 
            					 PO prioritize stories  
                                 Stories are stored in product backlog

            During the Grooming: Scrum team = SM, PO , Dev team
                                 PO explains the Stories & ACs 

                                 Estimate story points (optional)

story estimation: Fibonacci system is the most common used method
                  1 2 3 5 8 13 21  

                  1 point = 1 day work
                  1 point - 2 hours , 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12, 16 hours

 
            After the grooming what is the output? 
               1. Dev team understood the user stories & AC
               2. Each story is sized / given points 
               3. Now the Product backlog is full of pointed user stories & all of them are prioritized

Who decide the story points? 

1. PO ask to give points, and Developers & testers give points

2. PO & Developers give points (there is no testers involved estimation)






 Jira is app/software that IT companies use to manage project- work hours, documents like user story, bug report, test cases, test results, sprint activities, and scrum artifacts. 
 We will have Jira class soon, after you will have it to practice until you 'll graduate.


Sprint planing : conducted in the 1st day of sprint

During the sprint planning: 
    Step1: SM creates a sprint backlog in Jira 
    Step2: How many story points we can finish in this sprint? 
         - SM asked each person's availability for the sprint
         - SM ask question "do you have any day off? "
             Original team capacity : [ (dev num + QA num) * 8 days ] 

         - based on that , calculated the team's capacity 
   Step3: PO/BA takes the stories from backlog to sprint backlog 
   Step4: start the sprint 
           - SM click the button "Start sprint" on jira 
           - SM /PO write sprint Goal , choose the sprint starting & ending dat 






Product backlog -> user stories, tasks that needs to done to work on a project
                   There is only 1 PB

sprint backlog -> exact tasks (stories, bug..) needs to be done during the current sprint 
                 1 SB per sprint
                 SM created SB in the sprint planning meeting 




How many stories a team can finish in a sprint? 
- this is a wrong question. 

How many story points we can finish in a sprint? 


 1 sprint == 2 weeks == 10 days 

     Dev team can work on user stories only in 8 days. 

    1st day of each sprint - planning meeting, analyze user stories, assign task
    last day-> Demo meeting 

    
Team capacity : total work availability in a sprint 


        3 dev , 2 qa , 2 weeks , what is their team capacity? 

        (3+2) * 8 = 40 days

        8 dev , 4 qa -> (8+4) * 8 = 96 team capacity
     





who transfers them from product backlog to sprint backlog???
- PO 
- Could be BA 
- OR SM ? ?
