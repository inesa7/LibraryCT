Agenda: STLC- Test case creation 


STLC : testing life cycle 
       QA/sdet, performance testers, UAT testers all follow the STLC

 step1: Req analyze 
        in Agile, our req is written in User story format 

        understand the story + analyze if you can automate it or not 


       e.g: UI- user upload a file --> manual testing & (auto)Java + Selenium 
            As a user, i should be able to upload a file 

            DB- file upload function --> manual testing & (auto) Java + JDBC
            As a user, I want to see my files are saved in the Oracle DB.

            API - file upload function --> manual testing & (auto) Java + RestAssured
            As a user, I want to retrieve my file when I hit get method.


           Some PO writes 1 user story for 1 function, and creates several sub-task for the different layers. 

           As a user, i should be able to upload a file. 
             Sub-task 1:  UI upload a file
             Sub-task 2:  DB upload a file
             Sub-task 3: API upload a file


step 2: Test plan 

        In agile-scrum, we have a plan for each sprint. so some teams does not want to spend time to create test plan documents. 

        A test plan doc for each release. 
        when your release cycle is 3 months, that means you have one test plan every 3 months. 


              a test plan doc typically includes: 
                1. Introduction 
                     1.1 why we write this test plan doc? 
                     1.2 intro to the app 

                2.test strategy 
                    2.1 testing framework -> Cucumber framework 
                    2.2 testing tool with testing types/scopes
                    2.3 Environment 
                         2.3.1 testing environment - QA env & stg Env 
                         2.3.2 browsers and its versions or/and OS 

                3. Schedule 
                      starting and ending date for each sprint that are included by the release 

                4. Risk & Mitigation 
                       lack of team members 
                       too many vacation & holidays 
                       software issue
                       hardware issue
                       Environment issue 

                5. recourses 
                     software recourse -> jira, github, discord, intelliJ,jenkins ...
                     hardware recourse -> computer , monitor 

                6. Role & responsibilities 
                      QA team  
                         QA1 -> UI testing 
                         QA2 -> backend part -BD & API
                         QA3 -> fulltask 
                       
                
               7. approvals 
                       PM, team lead 


who creates a test plan doc? 
  - QA lead 
  - or Senior QA 







can we say also, one test plan is for one user story?  

As a user, i should be able to upload a file -> 10 pages test plan

As a user, i should be able to download  a file -> 11 pages test plan

As a user, i should be able to send an emoji -> 10 pages test plan 


-----------------
Asya can we create one test plan and start with it but in a process  of running to add changes or  modifications to it?..

- yes, we can make changes while we are working on again on our test plan 



Step 3 of STLC -> test case 

When do we write a test case? 
 
 - whenever you have a user story to test. 


So we write a test case based on AC? 

  one test case os written based on the function that described on the user story & make sure you included some AC. 



do we write one test case per user story? 
 
 - It depends 
 - but there is at least 1 test case per user story 




Login function -. user story 
                                           expected result
test case 1: login as an Admin               10 modules 
test case 2: login as a student               8 modules
test case 3: login as a teacher              10 modules
test case 4: login with wrong/invalid password 
test case 5: login with wrong/invalid username 
test case 6: click login button without any credentials 


after analyze my test cases description / test scenario / test case summary, i found that TC1 & TC3 has the same expected result, I can just create 1 test case.  



pre-condition : 

delete a picture from the website. -> user story 

pre-condition: there should be at least 1 picture is on the website. 



Edit a user account -> user story 

        Asiya --> Asya 

pre-condition: at least one account should be exist with original info 


Testing calendar on Canvas -> user story

pre-condition -> no need a pre-condition (login is not count as a pre-cond)

------

test steps : 

It does not start from login page/ function always. 

access to a course on Canvas -> user story 

  step1 : user on the dashboard 
  step2: user click a course (java)
  step3: user launch on the course page


search an item -> test data s the item name iphone? java book? 

fill a form -> data of birth -> the numbers are test data 
               name -> the name you use is test data 



interviewer asked you to open Facebook login page. How do you proof / verify that you opened the correct page? 

       - verify with the expected url 

           String expectedURL = "https://touch.facebook.com/login";

           String actualURL = driver.getURL():

           if(expectedURL.equal(actualURL))
           {
                 sout("test cases is PASSED")
           }else {
                 sout("test cases is Failed")
           }


       - verify with the expected title

There are 2 test case creation assignment on Canvas, please do it before next soft skill class. Write test cases on a word doc / any app
