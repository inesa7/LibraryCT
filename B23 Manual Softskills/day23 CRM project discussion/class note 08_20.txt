Agenda: 

- summary of STLC 
- talk about the project assignment confusing parts, or commonly asked parts
- learn Entry & exit criteria 

please compare your assignment result with mine: 

- I have the test cases for all 14 user stories under the "Jira sample" project.
 
     - open the jira 
     - click "project" module 
     - click view all projects 
     - type "jira sample" in the search box 
     - click the project 

     - inside the project, search your user story 
     - compare the test cases & test execution - bug tickets with yours 

=====================

AC:
1. Admin should has 14 tabs
2. teachers should has 12 tabs
3. Students have only the permitted tabs 


in this case, i need to create 3 different test cases. 

--------------------------------
are we creating one test case for each scenario ?
   
    - It Depends. 

Creating multiple test cases for one scenario: 
scenario: 1. users(teacher, admin, student) should be able to access to courses 
      - you will create 3 test cases for the above one scenario 

 creating one test case for one scenario: 
scenario 1. Admin should has 14 tabs
scenario 2. teachers should has 12 tabs
scenario 3.Students have only the permitted tabs 
       - you will create 1 test case for each scenario 

-------------------------------

admin, manager , normal users, 

scenario -> just one sentence , what to test 

            ex: 1. user create a vote
                2. user delete a file 
                3. hr add a new employee to the app 
                4. admin create new course on canvas 


test case : it is a document , how to test 
            ID 
            scenario
            environment 
            test steps 
            test data 
            expected result  

Jira alternative : ALM, bitbucket, bugzilla 

--------------------

Is test cases are used for the manual testing only?
 
  - no. you use your test cases for automation as well. 

----------------

Should I drag and drop my story that has a bug to "bug" column? or Done column?

   - Done is very special, and PO takes tickets to Done in Demo meeting. 

   - in cycbertek, your bug tickets will go to done later. 

---------------

who do we assign the bug ticket? 

  - in cybertek, no one, just leave it. 

  - in real work, it depends. 
        - assign to a dev 
                    the BA
                    the QA lead 

---------------------------
is there any chance to do one test case together? i mean with you, can you guide us? 
 - last Friday / 08/11 , I have create several test cases & execution in jira during the class. 

-------------

my test cases , bug, test execution tickets are not in the Sprint backlog. 


- in jira, all the new issues automatically stored under the backlog. However, you need to drag & drop into Sprint Backlog. 


     in real work, some companies keep all the tickets that created within the sprint inside the Sprint backlog to be more organized. 


     there are some companies they leave all the tickets under the backlog. 

---------------------------

Link feature of jira ? 

- story -> link -> all your test cases -> 1 test execution -> any bug 


----------------
delete feature in jira?
- as a student in cybertek, you do not have permit to delete any issue 

- as a QA at work, you do not have permit to delete any issue 

- PO , BA, PM, SM , team lead, tech lead or anyone the team think should be able to delete. 
-------------------------
workflow feature in jira? 

each issue has workflow like: 
 - To do 
 - In progress 
 - Done 

Active sprint module in jira ? 

- columns that shows the workflow of issues in the sprint. 

    - Sprint To do
    - Developing 
    - Testing 
    - bug 
    - code review (PR to master branch) 
    - Done

--------------------
can you show us, how to create multiple scenarios in Jira? 
 - you do not create scenario on Jira, 

 - jira issue types : test case, story, bug, test execution, task. 

 - Scenario are written in the test case summary 

------------------------
if i can not see the module by using 4 of 6 users, so i will create 4 bug tickets?


- no, you will create only one bug ticket. 

- bug ticket is manually created / report about a function that is not working as expected. 

 - one bug -> title will be: users can not see the module

-----------------

clone feature in jira? 
- make duplicate / copy 

- ex: you want to clone a test case.

    - open the test case you want to clone 
    - click "MORE" option 
    - select / click clone 
    - fill the summary with your new test case's scenario 
    - click clone button

--------------
Log work feature in jira? 

- you have to set a time that you are spending on a task. 

- ex: story-> login -> 2 days 

users send message by mentioning someone specifically 

---------------------------------

you have a test case, you forget one step. You added the test cases to your test execution, it does not allow you to add the forgotten step.
