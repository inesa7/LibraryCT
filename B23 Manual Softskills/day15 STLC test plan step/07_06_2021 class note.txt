SDLC -> 6 steps to build/develop a software 


Testing types :  static testing  -> testing docs  -> verification process

                 Dynamic testing -> code & application -> validation process

                   - Unit testing -> Developers perform , dev environment 
                   - Integration testing -> Developers perform , dev environment 

                   - System testing -> QA environment 
                         - Functional testing 
                                - Front-end /UI, API, DB testings (backend=DB+API)
                                - Smoke testing 
                                - Regression testing 

                         - Non - functional testing
                                - performance team test --> Jmeter tools
                                - Load test
                                - Stress test
                                - Volume test 

                   - User Acceptance testing (UAT) 
                                - the client / stakeholder  --> Beta testing
                                - UAT team members perform --> Alpha testing 


Project management methodology 

waterfall vs Agile 

Agile-Scrum : Scrum 3 roles      - PO , SM, Dev team
                    3 artifacts  - PB, SB, Burndown chart 
                    5 meetings   - Grooming, Sprint planning, Stand up, Demo, retro

----------------------------------------

STLC -> Software Testing LifeCycle 


What is STLC? == how do you test a user story ?  == how do you test a vending machine? 


1. req analyze -> make sure to understand the user story 
                  is this req/story is asking me to test the frontend? API?DB?
                  Can I automate this req/story? 



2. Testing plan 

 PO -> sending email features for the next release
       Oct 2 2021  

       test plan doc for this release : 

       1. introduction 
            - purpose of this doc 
                  -  schedule ,testing types , recourses, risk & mitigation , test strategy, 


           - intro to this project 
               - theme ? topic? what type of app is this? 
               - so far what we have developed? 


      2. test strategy 
           2.1 framework ? - e.g: cucumber framework 

           2.2 Scope of testing == testing types list  & its tools 


     3. Schedule 
        e.g: 
        July - Oct how many sprints are there?  starting & ending date? 
        around 6 sprint's date is listed 


     4. Role & responsibility 

         PM - approve the test plan doc 
               test strategy 
           
         Test lead - test plan doc is created by test lead 

         test team -> who execute the testings  
                     e.g: scrum team 4 QAs -> functional testing , smoke..

                          performance team -> non-functional testing           

                        
      5. recourses - software & hardware recourse 

                e.g: software recourse 
                     bug report - jira 
                     test case doc - jira 
                     code ide - IntelliJ 
                     version controle - Git / Github 
                     for some testing - VM , Jenkins 
                     communicate - discord 

                 e.g: hardware 
                      computer - HP
                      monitor - Samsung 

     6. Risk & mitigation 

              possible risk: schedule -> miss due date 
              solution     : 

              possible risk: hardware / computers had bugs/issues
                solution : extra hardware 


    7. Deliverables : test plan doc 
                     all the user stories July-Oct should be executes / tested 
                     no bugs are left 

                     test report -> screenshot , Github master repo, total # user stories , % of manual vs auto, how many test case docs are there? 
                                 this report is auto generated by Jira app 
                                 Team lead / test lead with PO , BA 



     8. Approval 

   

test plan doc - assign to you -> you'll be provide the team's or company's test plan template 

                 test plan meeting with the QA team 
                 v1.0 test plan doc 
                 test plan doc review meeting 
                 v2.0 test plan doc 
                 approve -> PM , PO , team lead 

test plan doc takes around 1 week / 2 weeks of time. 
E.g: last week, we release a new version. This week on Mon, PO told us the due date to the next release.  in this week, we start a new sprint and work on new user stories, meanwhile handle the test plan doc. 



======================
interview Q: 

what is a test plan? 
   - Doc 
   - there are several table of content like: intro to test plan, summary of the project, test strategy, scope of testing (list of the testing types), risk & mitigation, approvals, recourse .. 

   - in our scrum team, we have a test plan doc for each release 
   - our team lead responsible to create test plan doc 
     OR I create the test plan doc 


   - we implement Agile - scrum, so we do not have test plan doc (not recommended, but real example) 


do you have experience writing a test plan doc? 
 - yes or not is up to you

 we test it because ....


Regression test : big reg -before release,  every 3 months / 4 -6 months ,
