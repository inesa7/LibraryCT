==================================

bug == error == defect == mistake == unmatch == unexpected result 



===================================

1. we do not complete the sprint 1. just move all CRM related tickets inside. 



2. How Do I know if I created correct tickets for CRM assignment? 

    - compare with Asiya's tickets on jira - Jira sample project 
    = all 14 user stories has test cases + test execution. 


3. how do I know if I did correct or not in this Library assignment? 
   
     - this assignment has 2nd part. after that, each student will demo to their mentors. 

test case types: positive 
                 negative 

test case steps: manual step 
                 cucumber step + gherkin language 


====================
at work: PO/ BA creates US & AC.

at cybertek, for this library project assignment, Instructor is asking you to create US& AC on jira to practice. 





story analyze done 
test case is done 
env is ready?  the functionality that you are going to test is deployed from Dev to your QA env 

test execution : manual & automation 

              how do we manually test UI/frontend function ? 

                  - create test execution on jira -xray 
                  - add my all test cases to it 
                  - flow my test case steps & provide screenshot 

                  after mvn project creation, just follow the Selenium class package & class rule. 

                  each test case == 1 class 


ex: 
Given librarian is on the loginPage 
         get("url") 

Then verify that the title is “Login - Library”  
        expectedTitle = “Login - Library” 
        actualTitle = driver.getTitle() 

       if(driver.getTitle().equals("Title")) {
            System.out.println("match");
        }else{
            System.out.println("no match");
             System.out.println(expectedTitle ==)
             System.out.println(eactualTitle == )
        }

When librarian enters valid email address and password ]

         email = findElement (id="inputEmail") 
         sendKey() -> librarian23@library.com

       password = findElement (id="inputPassword") 
         sendKey() -> sdet2022*


And librarian click sign in button  
       click() 

Then verify that there are 3 modules the page
           <list>String expectedModules = {"Dashboard" , "Users", "Books" };

           List<webElements> actualModules = driver.findElements(id="menu_item);

                 getText() 


Given user is on the loginPage 
 get 
When user enters invalid email address or password 

          email = findElement (id="inputEmail") 
         sendKey() -> test@gmail.com  

       password = findElement (id="inputPassword") 
         sendKey() -> 123

And student click sign in button  

         click()
Then verify the error message “Sorry, Wrong Email or Password”
              


name convention -> java package rule , you have to write com.company name 
                   
                   package name - lower case
                   class name   - upper case
                   method name  - lower care
                   variable name  - depends 

                   group ID = company domain coms first then name 
                               org, io, com, net gov 
                   artifact ID = lower case

                    

verify if a new user is created : 


1. right after login - take the number of total users from homepage 

            String beforeAddingNewUser = driver.findElment(id).getText();

2. after created the user, then take the total users from homepage 

       String afterAddingNewUser = driver.findElment(id).getText();

       if beforeAddingNewUser - afterAddingNewUser
