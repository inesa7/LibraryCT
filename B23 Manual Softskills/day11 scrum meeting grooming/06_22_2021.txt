Good morning 

Afternoon will be Java 

Today's agenda: 
		review scrum roles
		new -> scrum meetings & some keywords 

Review: 
Scrum: software management methodology
       Scrum is one of the most used branch / framework 


       short time , gather feedback from client always  

Sprint: a time box   1 week - 4 weeks
        the most common used sprint cycle is: 2 weeks 
        no changes 


Scrum roles: 1. PO -> represent the Client 
                      gather req -> User story 
                      prioritize the req/stories 
                      maintain the Product backlog 

             2. SM -> facilitator 
                      daily stand up , retro are hosted SM
                      SM remove the block/impediments/problems

             3. Dev team -> Developers & testers

1 po, 1 SM, 2 dev, 1qa -> 5 ppl 

1PO, 1SM, 4 dev 3 qa -> 9 PPL 


1 project -> 1 Scrum team, 1 DevOps, 1 UAT team, 1 performance team

do the other teams use scrum methodology too ? 
- yes 

user story: req, the smallest version 

         As a <user>, I want to <do sth>, so that <benefit>

         e.g: As a teacher, I want to create a channel on Discord app so that I can communicate / send message to all the students at once. 

              As a user, I want to send message so that I can communicate. 


Before grooming: 
    PO write user stories & Acceptance Criteria
    PO prioritize the stories in Product backlog  


During the Grooming : 
   Po explains each story and its AC 

   Estimate user story effort time / giving points to stories



How to give point to a story? 

step 1. PO explain the story & AC
step 2. Dev team ask question 
step 3. give point - at work, use Agile card 
                online grooming, use the communication app  

    3 Dev: Ahmat -> 5 days to develop
           Mousa -> 3 days to develop 
           Mr.wang -> 5 days to develop
               eventually agree with 1 number -> 5 days / points

     2 qa : Komiljon -> 2 days to test
            Matt -> 2 days to test
                for qa team -> 2 days / points
          
                total this story is going to take: 8 days of time == 8 points


    login -> developers : 2 points 
             qa         : 5 points , 3? 

             total      : 8 points
       

  2 weeks == 10 days
  2 weeks == 8 days to work on the story 

first day -> just take time to analyze stories / prepare test case etc doc
last day is Demo, dev team do not work on any story 




   1 week == total 5 days to work , only 3 days to work on stories 



Fibonacci method: the most used one to estimate the user story point

          1,2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 211.Image, Developers give 5 days tester give 3 days. If developers deploy the code lately, What do we do? ...  


         Only use the number that is appeared in the Fibonacci 

         e.g. -> there is no 4 , so we do not give 4 points .


         1 point can be represented many hours / days. 

   1 point = 1 day 

   1 point = 4 hours , or 2days(12-16 hours)



  5 points == 5 days to develop & test 


Grooming meeting-> Scrum team go over / review / define each user story to understand it. Giving points to the stories. 

PO explains the story and AC. 




what do testers do while waiting for developers to finish their part?
 - write test case documents 


1.Image, Developers give 5 days tester give 3 days. If developers deploy the code lately, What do we do?
