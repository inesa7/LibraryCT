Agenda: 

STLC- Bug life cycle 

--------------------

Test case -> describing what to test ? how to test? 
             Jira -> project management tool to create Test case 

             
        ID -> unique number , Jira automatically generate ID for each Test case
                   prm01 , BOA34  

        test case description == test scenario == test case summary _. what to test 

               e.g: 
			      - login as a admin -> scenario
			      - login as a student -> scenario
			      - login as a mentor -> scenario

        Test environment  -> qa env / http://qa.example.com

        pre-condition : 

        test data : input 

        test steps : how to perform the function? 





As a user, I want to login to the app. 

    AC: login button should be displayed on the page under the password input box 
        username box should be displayed
        password box should be displayed


      - login as a admin  -> positive 
      - login as a student -> positive 
      - login as a mentor -> positive 
      - login with invalid username  ---> negative 
      - login without username or password  --> negative 
      - login with invalid password  --> negative



Test case example: 
  test case ID: can01 
  test scenario : login as a admin 
  test environment : qa env -> http://qa.canvas.com/login
  test data : username: admin01, admin02. admin23 
              password: 123abc

  test steps: 
             step1: user go to login page
             step2: user enter username & password
             step3: user click login button
             step4: verify that user login successfully and launched on the home page - system display 5 modules 

---------
 test case ID: can02 
  test scenario : login as a student
  test environment : qa env, http://qa.canvas.com/login
  test data : username: student1, student21,  student45,  
              password: 123abc

  test steps: 
             step1: user go to login page
             step2: user enter username & password
             step3: user click login button
             step4: verify that user login successfully and launched on the home page -> system display 3 modules 


Are we the one that divide the user story to different scenarios or somebody will tell us which scenarios to test?

    - most of time, qa/sdet create Test cases for his/her user story alone 

    - in some company, there are BA who will do it together.

        - after sprint planning meeting, BA and testers have a meeting to analyze test scenarios for all the user stories that should be completed within the sprint.  -> meeting name could be: test scenario review 




--------------

step1: user go to file download page 
step2: user download a file


----------------
story -> user download a file -> 2 points == to complete in 2 days 

AC: File Downloader" header should be displayed on the page 


test case: 
Summary: Displaying of "File Downloader" header.
Test data:
Environment:: http://practice.cybertekschool.com/download
Steps:
    Manual test case steps:
    step 1: user goes to file download page
    step 2: verify that "File Downloader" header is displayed



when we test our test cases, do we have to check them in different devices?(Iphone, Ipad, Laptop, Desktop, etc...)??? 

    - it depends on your project request 
    - normally you need to test with 2-3 browsers 

    - for the web-browser app, the laptop/device is the one that the company gave you. 

    - for the mobile app, it also depends on the company. a company might give you only one type pf device to test , or both iphone & andriod 


   - you cannot use your own computer. 




------------
for 1 user story, 3-5 test cases are common 



----------
User story: 
      As a user, I want to download files so that i can save them in my local device. 
Acceptance Criteria(AC): 
1. "File Downloader" header should be displayed  
2. All the required files should be displayed on the page


should we have a test case about canceling the file download? it is not required in story or ANY AC? 
   - we should ask from PO (if we have BA, we can ask from BA)

===================

Gherkin language, several key words used in test case steps: 

     Given -> the page that user should be 
             Given user on the forgot password page

     When  -> use it in the action 
               When user enter email 

     And -> extra actions
              And user click retrieve password button 

     Then --> result or verification part 
              Then verify the confirmation message displays



test case manual steps: 
user go to forgot password page 
user enter email & click the button
verify the confirmation message 


Given user on the forgot password page
When user enter email 
And user click retrieve password button 
Then verify the confirmation message displays

---------------

User story: 
   As a user, I want to download files so that i can save them in my local device.

Acceptance Criteria(AC): 
1. "File Downloader" header should be displayed  
2. All the required files should be displayed on the page


In some companies / teams, BA write the AC in Cucumber gherkin format with test scenario together. 


User story: 
   As a user, I want to download files so that i can save them in my local device.

Acceptance Criteria: 
   ac1 : 
   Scenario : user download a file
     Given: User on the  file downloads page
     Then: Verify "File Downloader" header is displayed
     Then: Verify all the required files are displayed on the page
     When user Click on the name of the file that need to be downloaded -> test.pdf
     And: user Click on the "Save" button in pop-up window  (Mac)
     Then:Verify that the name of the file is displayed in the local folder 




bug duplicated example: 
my story -> create a file 

your story -> export a file to different file version 

we can a common step to perform testing, e.g: click "file" button , that button is not working , then we bot created a bug report about it. 


-------------

bug life cycle -> start testing == test execution 
                  found a valid bug -> have to perform the testing with at least 3 different data & different env if possible to confirm 

                  New bug 

                  bug report 

                  assign the bug report to someone 

                  open the bug 

                  fix 

                  postpone - deferred == fix the bug later 

                  I will re-test the bug after it's fixed 

                      - has fixed? -> done 
                      - still has issue / bug? /not fixed --> re-assign to dev 


                   dev might reject the bug -> 1. invalid 2. duplicated 


what is the difference re-testing and regression testing? 

     - regression -> testing the all old & new functions before the release, and I have around 700 TC in my regression 

     - re-test is just test one function that has a bug , fixed by dev , by re-testing / testing again i need to confirm the bug is fixed/removed. 



After the bug fixed and we start to test for the second time. Is it going to be the same test case or we write a new one? 

   - it depends . 

   1. use the same test case when there is no changes on steps 

   2. Edit / make a changes the existing test case
