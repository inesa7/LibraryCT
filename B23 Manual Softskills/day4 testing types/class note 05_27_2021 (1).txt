Today's agenda: 

  - What is software testing? 
  - Static testing vs Dynamic testing 
  - Verification precess  vs Validation process 
  - Dynamic testing types == Software testing levels 
         - unit testing 
         - Integration testing
         - System testing
         - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)


 expected result == cleint's requirement 
 actual result == the output / actually result after performing testing


Static testing: testing documents , no codeing , performed manually


Dynamic testing: testing code and software
                 performed manually & automaticlly 




Verificatoin process : process of prepare documents, testing it(perform static testing) 


Validation process: process of write code, and test it (dynamic test)
                    
              e.g:  a frontend developer wrote code to build a login feature
                    then he/she performed dynamic testing to test the code 




who perform the static testing? 
    - whoever wrote a document, and all the poeple are related to the document.

    e.g: 1. in requirement gathering step, business team & client perform static testing 

         2.  in deisgn step, designers and client, maybe busniess team also perform static testing
